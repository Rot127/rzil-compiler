## Extended Euclid Algorithm

The test binary calculates the greatest common divisor with the help of the Extended Euclids algorithm.

Different binaries were compiled. Object files for Hexagon with different opimization levels. Each level should contain different instructions and get harder to emulate.

For comparison there is also a x86 binary which prints the results.
